// for the curious bunch. You'll learn all of this once you're in the bootcamp. But if you want to get a head start, here are some things

/* debugger in chrome
 * don't use it in the same tab as repl.it. It causes problems because Repl.it takes over the debugger
 * remove breakpoints but going to the breakpoints tab on the right. right click. click remove breakpoints
 */

/* debugger in VSCode
 * don't use with Quokka extension. Not a great interface for debugger.
 * you have to be in the right directory in terminal to be able to use the debugger. Best way to do this is to right click on the file in "explorer" tab in vscode and click on "open in integrated terminal"
 * once you're in the right directory...run node [filename].js
 *  don't use chrome debugger, use JS debugger. Best way to do this -> go to debugger extension. make sure "JavaScript Debugger" is selected not Chrome debugger in the "RUN AND DEBUG" dropdown
