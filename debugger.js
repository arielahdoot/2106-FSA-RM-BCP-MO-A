 * don't use it in the same tab as repl.it. It causes problems because Repl.it takes over the debugger
 */

/* debugger in VSCode
 * don't use with Quokka extension. Not a great interface.
 * you have to be in the right folder in terminal to be able to use the debugger
 * don't use chrome debugger, use JS debugger
